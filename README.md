# Love Maze: A Monthsary Celebration Game 

### P.S. A Note from the Developer (Me!)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project was a fantastic learning experience for me as a beginner full-stack engineer. While I've put a lot of effort into it, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Maze Walls:** You might notice you can go through the maze walls right now! Implementing true pixel-perfect collision detection for such an intricate, non-rectangular maze was my significant challenge for his beginner project.
* **Code Quality:** As a beginner, the code might be a bit messy in places. This project was all about applying fundamental concepts and solving problems, not necessarily writing the most optimized or elegant code. It's a snapshot of my learning journey!
* **Learning & Growth:** I focused on understanding *why* things work and building solutions myself, rather than just copying. Every bug and every solution was a step forward.

I'm really proud of what I built and the concepts I learned along the way. Thanks for checking it out!

## Overview

This is a charming and personalized web-based game I built to celebrate my 3rd monthsary! It's a fun, interactive experience designed to guide my girlfriend through a "love maze" to reach me for a kiss.

The project allowed me to apply my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a unique and heartfelt gift.

## Features

-   **Personalized Welcome Screen:** A custom greeting with a romantic "love season" theme and falling roses.
-   **Interactive Dialogue:** A short narrative introduction to the game's objective.
-   **Custom Pixel-Art Characters:** Features unique cartoon versions of us.
-   **Heart-Shaped Maze:** A visually appealing maze background.
-   **Intuitive Controls:** Navigate the maze using on-screen D-pad buttons or keyboard arrow keys.
-   **Win Condition:** A special moment and dialogue when the character reaches the destination.

## Getting Started Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jamessabby/love-maze.git](https://github.com/jamessabby/love-maze.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd love-maze
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:** You can simply double-click the `index.html` file, or use a local server like VS Code's Live Server extension for the best experience.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
-   **CSS3:** For styling, animations, flexbox, and grid layouts.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+):** For all game logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive elements.
-   **HTML Canvas API:** Utilized for rendering the maze and as a foundation for pixel-based collision (see P.S. below).
